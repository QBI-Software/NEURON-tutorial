# Quick Setup Guide for NEURON

## Download

NEURON can be downloaded for Windows, MAC and Linux from: [http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download)

## Test

To test your installation, click on (WIN) **NEURON demo** OR (MAC) **neurondemo**.

If you don't get a series of windows popping up, check the console window for errors and check the Troubleshooting pages for your OS on the download page.
If you still have difficulties, NEURON can be run from the QBI cluster which requires a login from IT.

If it all works, exit the application interface from the window called "NEURON Main Menu" under the File menu.

## Text editor

A plain text editor is required for editing the HOC code. (Programs like WORD are not plain text editors and cannot be used for code.) Your computer will have a basic text editor such as wordpad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). However these will be the most basic of text editors. The following editors are recommended if you don't have a favourite already.

1. [ATOM](https://atom.io) - the only editor I know of with HOC syntax highlighting! (to install this, go to Packages, search for `language-hoc` and install) - Multi-platform and very cool
1. [JEdit](http://jedit.org) - my favourite - extremely easy to use and Multi-platform
1. Notepad Plus (Windows)
1. ?Mac
