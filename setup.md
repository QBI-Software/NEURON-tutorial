If you don't get a series of windows popping up, check the console window for errors and check the Troubleshooting pages for your OS.
If you still have difficulties, NEURON can be run from the QBI cluster which requires a login from IT.

If it all works, exit the application interface from the window called "NEURON Main Menu" under the File menu.
