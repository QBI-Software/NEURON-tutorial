  <h3>Some programming concepts for non-programmers</h3>
  <h4>Variable</h4>
	<p>Programming languages allow you to store values which can be changed during the running of a program. These are given names of your choice and then set to a value with the <code>=</code> (equals) sign.</p>
	<h4>Procedure</h4>
	<p>A program will run through a series of steps which can be grouped together as a <em>procedure</em> and given a name of your choice followed by parentheses <code>()</code>.  <em>A procedure is called a &quot;method&quot; in most other languages.</em> 
	<ol>
		<li>A procedure must first be <em>defined</em> which is written as <code>proc methodname()</code> and contains the actual code to run within curly brackets <code>{}</code></li>
		<li>To get the procedure to run, it is <em>called</em> by the name and parentheses <code>methodname()</code>.</li>
	</ol>
