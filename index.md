## Welcome to the QBI NEURON tutorial

NEURON is a powerful simulation environment, allowing the detailed simulation of the nervous system in a wide range of scales - from channels to individual neurons to networks of neurons. In addition to the thousands of studies that have used NEURON, it is also the simulation environment used for large-scale projects such as the Blue Brain/Human Brain Projects.

We are offering an introductory workshop based on the recommended tutorials as well as actual experience used in generating models for research publications.  This is a one day workshop running through the basics of the NEURON interface then working up to loading experimental data and running simulations.

### Installation

NEURON software is freely available from [https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/).
Prior to the tutorial, please download and install NEURON on your system - you can refer to our [Quick Setup](setup.md).
