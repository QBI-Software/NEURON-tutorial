      <h2>Welcome to the QBI Software NEURON Tutorial</h2>

<p>NEURON is a powerful simulation environment, allowing the detailed simulation of the nervous system in a wide range of scales - from channels to individual neurons to networks of neurons. In addition to the thousands of studies that have used NEURON, it is also the simulation environment used for large-scale projects such as the Blue Brain/Human Brain Projects. We are offering an introductory workshop based on the recommended tutorials as well as actual experience used in generating models for research publications.  </p><p>
The workshop will be primarily run by Lee Fletcher and Liz Cooper-Williams, but anyone with experience is more than welcome to assist. This would be a one day workshop running through the basics of the NEURON interface then working up to loading experimental data and running simulations. NEURON software is freely available from https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/.</p>
