  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
